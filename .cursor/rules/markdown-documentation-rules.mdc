# Markdown Rules

- Ensure to add blank lines before and after headers and lists
- Always specify a language for code blocks 
- Avoid adding duplicated content
- Be factual and casual with writing style. Don't add "features" or "benefits" to documentation that attempt to sell the solution
- Use markdown headers instead of **Bold Section Titles**
