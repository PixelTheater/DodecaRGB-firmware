# PixelTheater Development Plan

Reference docs:
‼️ @model.md : Model structure and data format documentation
‼️ @scene.md : Scene class documentation

## Current Status (Updated)

### Completed Features ✓

1. Core Model Implementation
- Point system with coordinates and IDs
- LED array access and manipulation
- Face management and indexing
- Collection operations (fill, iterate)
- Model definition integration
- Basic geometric operations

### In Progress

1. Neighbor Relationship System
- Neighbor detection and access
- Distance-based queries
- Geometric helper functions

2. Scene Integration
- Model usage in scenes
- Parameter system integration
- Animation framework support

## Next Steps

A. Complete Neighbor System
- Implement findNearby() for radius-based LED selection
- Add distance-based operations
- Optimize neighbor lookups

B. Enhance Geometric Operations
- Add coordinate space transformations
- Implement common geometric patterns
- Add helper functions for animations

C. Scene Framework Integration
- Document model usage patterns in scenes
- Add example animations using model features
- Create testing utilities for scenes

D. Performance Optimization
- Profile common operations
- Optimize critical paths
- Add benchmarking tests

Would you like me to focus on implementing any particular aspect of these next steps?
