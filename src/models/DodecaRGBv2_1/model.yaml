# Assembly sequence - defines how PCBs connect in series
# - face: PCB number (0-11) for assembly and wiring order
# - type: PCB shape type
# - rotation: clockwise steps, 360/num_sides (72 for pentagon, 60 for hexagon)
# - remap_to: (optional) use geometric position of different face ID for LED positioning
#
# Example of face remapping:
# If the physical wiring order doesn't match the geometric layout, use remap_to:
#   - id: 0
#     type: pentagon
#     remap_to: 2    # Use geometric position where face 2 should be
#     rotation: 1
